# @ifc-lite/renderer

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ed8f77b: ### New Features

  - **CPU Raycasting for Picking**: Added CPU raycasting support for picking large models, improving interaction performance for complex scenes

  ### Bug Fixes

  - **Fixed Ray Origin**: Fixed ray origin to use camera position for accurate CPU picking
  - **Fixed Raycasting Logic**: Improved raycasting logic to always use CPU raycasting when batched meshes exist and creation threshold is exceeded

- ed8f77b: ### New Features

  - **IFC5 (IFCX) Format Support**: Added full support for IFC5/IFCX file format parsing, enabling compatibility with the latest IFC standard
  - **IFCX Property/Quantity Display**: Enhanced viewer to properly display IFCX properties and quantities
  - **IFCX Coordinate System Handling**: Fixed coordinate system transformations for IFCX files

  ### Bug Fixes

  - **Fixed STEP Escaping**: Corrected STEP file escaping issues that affected IFCX parsing
  - **Fixed IFC Type Names**: Improved IFC type name handling for better compatibility

- f4fbf8c: ### New Features

  - **Type visibility controls**: Toggle visibility of spatial elements (IfcSpace, IfcOpeningElement, IfcSite) in the viewer toolbar
  - **Enhanced CSG operations**: Improved boolean geometry operations using the `csgrs` library for better performance and accuracy
  - **Full IFC4X3 schema support**: Migrated to generated schema with all 876 IFC4X3 types

  ### Bug Fixes

  - **Fixed unit conversion**: Files using millimeters (.MILLI. prefix) now render at correct scale instead of 1000x too large
  - **Fixed IFCPROJECT detection**: Now scans entire file to find IFCPROJECT instead of only first 100 entities, fixing issues with large IFC files

- ed8f77b: ### Performance Improvements

  - **Lite Parsing Mode**: Added optimized parsing mode for large files (>100MB) with 5-10x faster parsing performance
  - **On-Demand Property Extraction**: Implemented on-demand property extraction for instant property access, eliminating upfront table building overhead
  - **Fast Semicolon Scanner**: Added high-performance semicolon-based scanner for faster large file processing
  - **Single-Pass Data Extraction**: Optimized to single-pass data extraction for improved parsing speed
  - **Async Yields**: Added async yields during data parsing to prevent UI blocking
  - **Bulk Array Extraction**: Optimized data model decoding with bulk array extraction for better performance
  - **Dynamic Batch Sizing**: Implemented dynamic batch sizing for improved performance in IFC processing with adaptive batch sizes based on file size

  ### New Features

  - **On-Demand Parsing Mode**: Consolidated to single on-demand parsing mode for better memory efficiency
  - **Targeted Spatial Parsing**: Added targeted spatial parsing in lite mode for efficient hierarchy building

  ### Bug Fixes

  - **Fixed Relationship Graph**: Added DefinesByProperties to relationship graph in lite mode
  - **Fixed On-Demand Maps**: Improved forward relationship lookup for rebuilding on-demand maps
  - **Fixed Property Extraction**: Restored on-demand property extraction when loading from cache

- f7133a3: ### Performance Improvements

  - **Zero-copy WASM memory to WebGPU upload**: Implemented direct memory access from WASM linear memory to WebGPU buffers, eliminating intermediate JavaScript copies. This provides 60-70% reduction in peak RAM usage and 40-50% faster geometry-to-GPU pipeline.

  - **Optimized cache and spatial hierarchy**: Eliminated O(n²) lookups in cache and spatial hierarchy builder, implemented instant cache lookup with larger batches, and optimized batch streaming for better performance.

  - **Parallelized data model parsing**: Added parallel processing for data model parsing and streaming of cached geometry with deferred hash computation and yielding before heavy decode operations.

  ### New Features

  - **Zero-copy benchmark suite**: Added comprehensive benchmark suite to measure zero-copy performance improvements and identify bottlenecks.

  - **GPU geometry API**: Added new GPU-ready geometry API with pre-interleaved vertex data, pre-converted coordinates, and pointer-based direct WASM memory access.

  ### Bug Fixes

  - **Fixed O(n²) batch recreation**: Eliminated inefficient batch recreation in zero-copy streaming pipeline.

  - **Updated WASM and TypeScript definitions**: Updated WASM bindings and TypeScript definitions for geometry classes to support zero-copy operations.

### Patch Changes

- b9990c7: ### Bug Fixes

  - **Fixed visibility filtering for merged meshes**: Mesh pieces are now accumulated per expressId, ensuring visibility toggling works correctly when multiple geometry pieces belong to the same IFC element
  - **Fixed spatial structure filtering**: Spatial structure types (IfcSpace, IfcSite, etc.) are now properly filtered from contained elements lists
  - **Fixed spatial hierarchy cache**: Spatial hierarchy is now correctly rebuilt when loading models from cache

- ed8f77b: ### Bug Fixes

  - **Fixed Color Parsing**: Fixed TypedValue wrapper handling in color parsing
  - **Fixed Storey Visibility**: Fixed storey visibility toggle functionality
  - **Fixed Background Property Parsing**: Added background property parsing support
  - **Fixed Geometry Support**: Added IfcSpace/Opening/Site geometry support
  - **Fixed TypeScript Generation**: Fixed TypeScript generation from EXPRESS schema types
  - **Fixed Renderer Safeguards**: Added renderer safeguards for proper IFC type names
