# @ifc-lite/geometry

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f4fbf8c: ### New Features

  - **2D Profile-Level Boolean Operations**: Implemented efficient 2D polygon boolean operations for void subtraction at the profile level before extrusion. This provides 10-25x performance improvement over 3D CSG operations for most openings and produces cleaner geometry with fewer degenerate triangles.

  - **Void Analysis and Classification**: Added intelligent void classification system that distinguishes between coplanar voids (can be handled efficiently in 2D) and non-planar voids (require 3D CSG). This enables optimal processing strategy selection.

  - **Enhanced Void Handling**: Improved void subtraction in extrusions with support for both full-depth and partial-depth voids, including segmented extrusion for complex void configurations.

  ### Improvements

  - **WASM Compatibility**: Replaced `clipper2` (C++ dependency) with `i_overlay` (pure Rust) for WASM builds, eliminating C++ compilation issues and ensuring reliable WASM builds.

  - **Performance**: Profile-level void subtraction is significantly faster than 3D CSG operations, especially for floors/slabs with many penetrations.

- f4fbf8c: ### New Features

  - **Type visibility controls**: Toggle visibility of spatial elements (IfcSpace, IfcOpeningElement, IfcSite) in the viewer toolbar
  - **Enhanced CSG operations**: Improved boolean geometry operations using the `csgrs` library for better performance and accuracy
  - **Full IFC4X3 schema support**: Migrated to generated schema with all 876 IFC4X3 types

  ### Bug Fixes

  - **Fixed unit conversion**: Files using millimeters (.MILLI. prefix) now render at correct scale instead of 1000x too large
  - **Fixed IFCPROJECT detection**: Now scans entire file to find IFCPROJECT instead of only first 100 entities, fixing issues with large IFC files

- ed8f77b: ### Performance Improvements

  - **Lite Parsing Mode**: Added optimized parsing mode for large files (>100MB) with 5-10x faster parsing performance
  - **On-Demand Property Extraction**: Implemented on-demand property extraction for instant property access, eliminating upfront table building overhead
  - **Fast Semicolon Scanner**: Added high-performance semicolon-based scanner for faster large file processing
  - **Single-Pass Data Extraction**: Optimized to single-pass data extraction for improved parsing speed
  - **Async Yields**: Added async yields during data parsing to prevent UI blocking
  - **Bulk Array Extraction**: Optimized data model decoding with bulk array extraction for better performance
  - **Dynamic Batch Sizing**: Implemented dynamic batch sizing for improved performance in IFC processing with adaptive batch sizes based on file size

  ### New Features

  - **On-Demand Parsing Mode**: Consolidated to single on-demand parsing mode for better memory efficiency
  - **Targeted Spatial Parsing**: Added targeted spatial parsing in lite mode for efficient hierarchy building

  ### Bug Fixes

  - **Fixed Relationship Graph**: Added DefinesByProperties to relationship graph in lite mode
  - **Fixed On-Demand Maps**: Improved forward relationship lookup for rebuilding on-demand maps
  - **Fixed Property Extraction**: Restored on-demand property extraction when loading from cache

- f7133a3: ### Performance Improvements

  - **Zero-copy WASM memory to WebGPU upload**: Implemented direct memory access from WASM linear memory to WebGPU buffers, eliminating intermediate JavaScript copies. This provides 60-70% reduction in peak RAM usage and 40-50% faster geometry-to-GPU pipeline.

  - **Optimized cache and spatial hierarchy**: Eliminated O(n²) lookups in cache and spatial hierarchy builder, implemented instant cache lookup with larger batches, and optimized batch streaming for better performance.

  - **Parallelized data model parsing**: Added parallel processing for data model parsing and streaming of cached geometry with deferred hash computation and yielding before heavy decode operations.

  ### New Features

  - **Zero-copy benchmark suite**: Added comprehensive benchmark suite to measure zero-copy performance improvements and identify bottlenecks.

  - **GPU geometry API**: Added new GPU-ready geometry API with pre-interleaved vertex data, pre-converted coordinates, and pointer-based direct WASM memory access.

  ### Bug Fixes

  - **Fixed O(n²) batch recreation**: Eliminated inefficient batch recreation in zero-copy streaming pipeline.

  - **Updated WASM and TypeScript definitions**: Updated WASM bindings and TypeScript definitions for geometry classes to support zero-copy operations.
