Add basket presentation system with saved views, smart input sources, and presentation dock UI. The basket (pinboard) now supports saving named views with camera viewpoints, section plane state, and canvas thumbnails. Smart input resolution automatically picks the best source (selection, hierarchy, or visible scene) for basket operations. A new floating presentation dock provides set/add/remove controls and a scrollable strip of saved views for rapid scene navigation.
